● Great content. Here are my questions for updating the website based on this document:                                                                 
                                                                                                                                                        
  1. The "Lookbook Link" Revenue Story                                                                                                                  
  The document emphasizes that the lookbook works two ways: in-house QR and as an online visit-driver. The current site doesn't make this distinction   
  clear. Should I add a section showing:                                                                                                                
  - In-house QR → better upsells                                                                                                                        
  - Online link → drives new visits                                                                                                                     
                                                                                                                                                        
  2. The PDF Problem                                                                                                                                    
  This is a strong pain point in the doc ("Beautiful food deserves more than a PDF") but not on the current site. Add a brief "The PDF Problem" callout 
  in the Problem section?                                                                                                                               
                                                                                                                                                        
  3. Unused Taglines                                                                                                                                    
  Some strong lines not currently on the page:                                                                                                          
  - "A picture is worth a thousand words. A dish photo is worth an order."                                                                              
  - "This isn't a menu. It's a lookbook."                                                                                                               
  - "From 'what do you have?' to 'we need to go there.'"                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                        
  Want any of these added or swapped in?                                                                                                                
                                                                                                                                                        
  4. "Sell the Visit" Framing                                                                                                                           
  The doc says: "Traditional menus answer 'What do you have?' The Lookbook Link answers 'We should go there.'" This is powerful and not on the site. Add
   to the Aha section?                                                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                        
  5. No App / No Learning Curve                                                                                                                         
  The doc emphasizes "No tutorial. No app. No learning curve." Should this be more prominent (maybe under How It Works or as a small badge/callout)?    
                                                                                                                                                        
  6. Companion, Not Replacement                                                                                                                         
  The "perfect companion to printed menu" angle isn't on the site. Worth adding to address objections?                                                  
                                                                                                                                                        
  Let me know which of these you want me to implement.                                                                                                  
                                                                                                                                                        
❯ And potential guests are looking at a pdf with words when your beautiful food closes the deal.                                                        
                                                                                                                                                        
● That's a strong line — it sharpens the pain point perfectly.                                                                                          
                                                                                                                                                        
  So the tension becomes:                                                                                                                               
  - Your kitchen → producing beautiful food that sells itself                                                                                           
  - Your online menu → a PDF with words that hides it                                                                                                   
                                                                                                                                                        
  Should I add a "PDF Problem" callout to the Problem section using that angle? Something like:                                                         
                                                                                                                                                        
  Your food closes the deal. But right now, potential guests are looking at a PDF full of words.
